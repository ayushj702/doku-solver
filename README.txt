Sudoku Solver by ayushj702

A sample Sudoku problem is already added in the "sudoku.txt" file.

To test your own, you need to add the problem in the "sudoku.txt" file 
(blank spaces are represented by the '*')

To run the program, build and run the main.cpp file.

The file in which the solved sudoku will be saved is named, "solved.txt".
Since github doesn't allow upload of empty files, I have uploaded the
file with a solved sudoku puzzle. The program will overwrite it :)

All the files, that is, header and main are to be put in one folder.
